# CandyShop
This is a Java project I made for my CSC 231 final at ECSU during my Spring 2020 semester.

I plan to update this project in the future with my updated knowledge of java and the use of JFrames.

Any suggestions are welcome! This is just a for-fun project, and I have no intentions to use this for anything outside of practice with java JFrames.

Below is an image of the app's basic GUI.
